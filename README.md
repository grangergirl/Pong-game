# Spider-Pong

The html file contained in this repository is a basic version of the famous Pong game. It is a 2 player game, with one player controlling each of the left and right paddles.
The game gets loaded on clicking the Start button, and further can be paused, and also can be restarted once a game gets over.
A simple draw function is used for the movement of the paddles and the ball's animation is achieved by using requestAnimationFrame.
